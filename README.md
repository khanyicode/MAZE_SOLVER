# Maze Solver

This Maze Solver is a Python program that utilizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze. The program takes a maze as input, where '#' represents walls and '.' represents open paths, and outputs the solution path.

## Usage

1. Replace the `grid` variable with your own maze in the Python code.
2. Reset the window size to your preferred size.
3. Adjust the size of the maze block according to your preferences.

## Instructions

### Maze Representation

- The maze is represented using a 2D list, where '#' represents walls and '.' represents open paths.

### Setting the Maze

- Replace the following line in the Python code with your maze:

# Window Size
- Adjust the window size by modifying the appropriate parameters in the code

# Maze Block Size
- Change the size of the maze block according to your preference

```python
grid = [
    "##########",
    "#........ #",
    "#.#######.#",
    "#.#.......#",
    "#.#.######.#",
    "#.#.#......#",
    "#.#.#.#####.#",
    "#.#.#.#.....#",
    "#.#.#.#######",
    "#...........#",
    "##########.##"
]
